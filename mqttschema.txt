Can also add via_device
Need to consider what the bridge device is: sia2mqtt? then have each zone as a separate device (with open/closed or on/off) and a single device for "alarm" that has 
entities of "set" (set/unset, part set), "alarm status" (intruder, confirmed intruder, fire, confirmed fire, pa, tamper).
